# Phase Code Disk Approach

## Derivation of river morphology using satellite images
### Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A

Delineate river morphology using Phase Code Disk Approach

Phase Code Disk  delineate that "Magnitude peak” and “Phase image”

Phase image provides river direction


Magnitude Peak provides width and centerline of a Mobile River
